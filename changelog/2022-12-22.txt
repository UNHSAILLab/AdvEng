[REPLACED] Relationship "hasEventScript with ObjectProperty engage:hasEventScript
[UPDATED] AdvEng diagram to reflect the removal and restructure of classes
[REMOVED] Facets, not currently necessary
[REMOVED] Time, uco-action's startTime and endTime can replace most of the functionality

[TO-BE-DISCUSSED] Intended use of uco-action:result. E.g. Alert is the action of which we are informed of an event, but
logically alert is not casual of the event.
[REMOVED] Adversary, Defender roles since they are instances instead of classes.
[TO-BE-DISCUSSED] Distinction and/or inclusion/exclusion of general actions for AE operations
[TO-BE-DISCUSSED] Post analysis may be covered by CASE, however it usually describes the forensic investigation process
rather than the deduction made from the analysis. Who takes the domain?
