## Upcoming Changes

1. Add a `Beacon` action class which will be used to describe the relationship of action classes:
    - `performer(property)` restricted to range instances of `uco-core:ObservableObject`
    - `object(property)` restricted to instances of `uco-core:ObservableObject`.
- This is to differentiate between action classes with `object(property)` of range `uco-core:ObservableObject` and `performer(property)` of range `uco-identity:Identity`. Foreseeably, we may find value in separating actions performed between systems and systems and actions performed between people and systems.
- `engagment:Alert` is explicitly designed for object-identity actions, but for now it is abused to be used for all.

2. Add a `DataCollectionEndpoint` object class to describe the object which collects or listens for data, in comparison to `DataSource` which refers to some source that generates or produces data.
