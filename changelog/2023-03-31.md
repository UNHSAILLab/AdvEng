## Changes

1. [ADD] `engagement:Beacon` [NEEDS TO BE MODIFIED]
    - `performer(property)` restricted to range instances of `uco-observable:ObservableObject`
    - `object(property)` restricted to instances of `uco-observable:ObservableObject`.

2. [ADD] `DataTarget` object class to describe the object which collects or listens for data, in comparison to `DataSource` which refers to some source that generates or produces data.

3. [CHANGE] `engagement:BreadcrumbTrail` and `engagement:Breadcrumb` to have a property called `engagement:breadcrumbTargetObject`which indentifies the intended goal-state or goal-object/intended resource the `engagement:Breadcrumb` or `engagement:BreadcrumbTrail` is attempting to have an adversary reach.
    - For example, let's say there is a breadcrumb trail consisting of two breadcrumbs that leads to a file containing a honeytoken. The first breadcrumb is a pdf indicating the important data servers containing all sensitive data, the second breadcrumb is a folder with an attractive, then the target object of the breadcrumb is the honeytoken. This goal-object can be a traditional `uco-observable:ObservableObject` besides a deception object.
