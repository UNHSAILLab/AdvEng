## Changes

1. [ADD] `engagement:hasPerceptionCharacterization`
        - Acts like `hasCharacterization` property except applies to the perceived object by the adversary instead of the actual perception of the defender. E.g., suppose a server is capable of hosting multiple honeypots. An adversary will perceive it to be a single user endpoint running services, but it is actual a server.

2. [CHANGE] `engagement:LureObject` now has the property `engagement:hasPerceptionCharacterization`

3. [RENAME] `engagement:hasStageAttackSurface`-> `engagement:hasAttackSurface`
    - Property attaches UcoObject which are relevant to the attack surface of the object. E.g., the available planned paths an adversary will take to access or compromise the object.
4. [REMOVED] StageAttackSurface (depreciated, no longer necessary given `engagement:hasAttackSurface` directly attaches to a UcoObject.
5. [REMOVED] Stage (depreciated for the `engagement:hasPerceptionCharacterization`)
