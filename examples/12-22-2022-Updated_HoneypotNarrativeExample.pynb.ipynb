    "- `Storyline` is used to describe a set of events which relate to each other for a single trajectory of a deception operation.\n",
    "- `Narrative` or alternatively a deception campaign is the association to any and all sequences of events tied to a single identity campaign.\n",
    "- `Relationship` comes from UCO and requires adoption\n",
    "- All action classes e.g. `Access`, `Alert` rely UCO's action class and its current properties, please note the adoption.\n",
    "- `Relationship` is used to describe ordinal relationships between Events instead of properties to allow for flexibility across multiple Storylines"
