This simple example outlines how to describe a simple and bare example of how to the breadcrumb ae object and attach objectives to `lureObjects`.

In this example, you will see how to use:
- `engage:Breadcrumb`
- `engage:Stage`
- `Objective:Lure`


Additionally there is the `engage:BreadcrumbTrail` object in case where the breadcrumbs themselves have some partial ordering. Alternatively, one can describe `engage:Breadcrumb` with multiple `uco-core:UcoObject(s)` if all components as a whole is the breadcrumb concept.
